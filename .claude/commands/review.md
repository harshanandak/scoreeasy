description: Address ALL PR issues (GitHub Actions, Greptile, SonarCloud, CI/CD)
---

Process ALL pull request issues including GitHub Actions failures, Greptile inline comments, SonarCloud analysis, and other CI/CD checks.

# Review

This command handles ALL issues that arise after creating a pull request.

## Usage

```bash
/review <pr-number>
```

## What This Command Does

### Step 1: Fetch Complete PR Status
```bash
# Get full PR details including all checks
gh pr view <pr-number> --json number,url,isDraft,reviews,statusCheckRollup,comments

# Check individual status checks
gh pr checks <pr-number>
```

Review ALL status checks:
- GitHub Actions workflows
- Greptile code review (inline comments + summary)
- SonarCloud quality gate
- Any other CI/CD integrations
- Vercel deployments
- Security scanners

### Step 2: Address GitHub Actions Failures

If any GitHub Actions workflows fail:

```bash
# View failed workflow logs
gh run view <run-id> --log-failed

# Identify failure cause:
# - Build failures
# - Test failures
# - Lint/type check failures
# - Deployment failures
# - Security scan failures
```

**For each failure**:
1. **Analyze the error**: Read logs to understand root cause
2. **Fix the issue**: Make necessary code changes
3. **Re-run checks**: GitHub Actions will auto-rerun on push
4. **Document fix**: Note what was fixed in commit message

**Common GitHub Actions Issues**:
- Build failures: Missing dependencies, compilation errors
- Test failures: Failing test cases (should not happen if /validate passed)
- Lint failures: Code style violations
- Type failures: TypeScript type errors
- Deployment failures: Env vars, configuration issues

### Step 3: Process Greptile Review

Greptile provides TWO types of feedback:
1. **Inline comments** on specific code lines
2. **Summary** with overall recommendations

**IMPORTANT**: Use the **systematic Greptile resolution process** documented in `.claude/rules/greptile-review-process.md`. This process has been standardized to ensure:
- All threads are replied to directly (not as separate PR comments)
- All threads are marked as resolved after fixing
- No manual tracking overhead for maintainers

#### 3A. Check Greptile Inline Comments (Use Systematic Process)

**Step 1: List all unresolved threads**
```bash
bash .claude/scripts/greptile-resolve.sh list <pr-number> --unresolved
```

This shows:
- Thread ID (for resolving)
- Comment ID (for replying)
- File path and line number
- Issue description

**Step 2: For EACH unresolved thread:**

1. **Understand the issue**
   - Read the comment carefully
   - Check the file and line number

2. **Categorize the comment**:
   - **Valid**: Should be implemented (security issue, bug, clear improvement)
   - **Invalid**: Greptile misunderstood context
   - **Conflicting**: Contradicts research decisions with good reason
   - **Out of scope**: Valid but not for this PR

3. **Fix the issue** (if valid)
   - Make code changes
   - Commit with clear message

4. **Reply and resolve** (for ALL comments, even invalid ones)
   ```bash
   # For valid issues (fixed):
   bash .claude/scripts/greptile-resolve.sh reply-and-resolve <pr-number> <comment-id> <thread-id> \
     "✅ Fixed: [description]

     Changed: [what was changed]
     Reason: [why this fixes the issue]
     Commit: [commit-sha]"

   # For invalid/conflicting issues:
   bash .claude/scripts/greptile-resolve.sh reply-and-resolve <pr-number> <comment-id> <thread-id> \
     "This approach is correct because:
     - Reasoning: [from design doc]
     - Evidence: [link to source]
     - Alternative considered: [what Greptile suggested]
     - Why rejected: [specific reason]

     See: docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>-design.md (Decision #X)"
   ```

**Step 3: Verify all resolved**
```bash
bash .claude/scripts/greptile-resolve.sh stats <pr-number>
```
Should show: "✓ All Greptile threads resolved!"

**See complete process**: `.claude/rules/greptile-review-process.md`

#### 3B. Check Greptile Summary
```bash
# Greptile usually posts a summary comment on the PR
# Review the overall assessment and recommendations
```

The summary typically includes:
- Overall code quality assessment
- Key issues to address
- Security concerns
- Performance considerations
- Best practice violations

### Step 4: Analyze SonarCloud (via sonarcloud skill)

```bash
# Use sonarcloud skill to query PR-specific issues
/sonarcloud
```

**What SonarCloud does**: Static code analysis for quality, security, and maintainability

**How it helps**:
- Identifies code smells and technical debt
- Finds security vulnerabilities (complementing OWASP Top 10)
- Calculates code coverage
- Tracks code duplication
- Assesses maintainability

**Query PR-specific data**:
- Quality gate status (pass/fail)
- New issues introduced in this PR
- Security hotspots
- Code coverage changes
- Technical debt added

**Prioritize issues**:
1. **Blocker/Critical**: Must fix before merge
2. **Major**: Should fix if valid
3. **Minor/Info**: Optional improvements

### Step 5: Check Other CI/CD Tools

Review any other automated checks:
- **Vercel**: Preview deployment successful?
- **Security scanners**: Any vulnerabilities detected?
- **Custom scripts**: Any failures?
- **Dependency checks**: Outdated or vulnerable packages?

### Step 6: Categorize and Prioritize ALL Issues

Create a master list of all issues from:
- GitHub Actions failures
- Greptile inline comments
- Greptile summary recommendations
- SonarCloud issues
- Other CI/CD tool failures

Prioritize by:
1. **Critical**: Blocks merge (failing tests, security vulnerabilities, build failures)
2. **High**: Should address (valid bugs, important improvements)
3. **Medium**: Optional but valuable (code quality, best practices)
4. **Low**: Nice to have (minor refactorings, style suggestions)

### Step 7: Address Issues Systematically

For **GitHub Actions failures** (Critical):
```bash
# Fix the issue
# Commit with clear description
git add .
git commit -m "fix: resolve GitHub Actions failure in <workflow-name>

- Fixed: [specific issue]
- Root cause: [explanation]
- Solution: [what was changed]"

git push
# Actions will auto-rerun
```

For **Greptile inline comments** (Use Systematic Script):
```bash
# Use the standardized Greptile resolution script
# See .claude/rules/greptile-review-process.md for complete process

# For valid comments (fixed):
bash .claude/scripts/greptile-resolve.sh reply-and-resolve <pr-number> <comment-id> <thread-id> \
  "✅ Fixed: [description]

  Changed: [what was changed]
  Reason: [why this fixes the issue]
  Commit: [commit-sha]"

# For invalid/conflicting comments:
bash .claude/scripts/greptile-resolve.sh reply-and-resolve <pr-number> <comment-id> <thread-id> \
  "This approach is correct because:
  - Reasoning: [from design doc]
  - Evidence: [link to source]
  - Alternative considered: [what Greptile suggested]
  - Why rejected: [specific reason]

  See: docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>-design.md (Decision #X)"

# Verify all threads resolved:
bash .claude/scripts/greptile-resolve.sh stats <pr-number>
```

For **Greptile summary recommendations**:
```bash
# Add a PR comment addressing the summary
gh pr comment <pr-number> --body "## Greptile Summary Response

Addressed all key recommendations:
- [Recommendation 1]: ✓ Fixed in commit <sha>
- [Recommendation 2]: ✓ Explained (see inline response)
- [Recommendation 3]: ⏭️ Out of scope for this PR (created issue bd-xxx)

All critical and high-priority items resolved."
```

For **SonarCloud issues** (via sonarcloud skill):
```bash
# For critical/blocker issues: Fix immediately
# For security vulnerabilities: Fix immediately
# For code smells: Fix if valid, justify if not

# After fixes, SonarCloud will re-analyze on next push
```

For **other CI/CD failures**:
```bash
# Debug the specific tool's logs
# Fix the underlying issue
# Commit and push
# Verify the check passes
```

### Step 8: Commit ALL Fixes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "fix: address ALL PR review feedback

GitHub Actions:
- Fixed: [list of workflow failures resolved]

Greptile:
- Fixed: [list of valid inline comments addressed]
- Explained: [list of invalid comments with reasoning]
- Summary: [key recommendations addressed]

SonarCloud:
- Fixed: [security vulnerabilities and critical issues]
- Justified: [code smells that are intentional]

Other CI/CD:
- Fixed: [any other tool failures]

All review feedback resolved, all checks passing."

git push
```

### Step 9: Verify ALL Checks Pass

```bash
# Check status immediately, then poll for at most 60 seconds
gh pr checks <pr-number>

# If checks are still pending after 60 seconds: STOP and tell the user to return
# when CI finishes or new review feedback appears.
#
# Ensure all completed status checks are green:
# ✓ GitHub Actions workflows
# ✓ Greptile review (no unresolved critical comments)
# ✓ SonarCloud quality gate
# ✓ Other CI/CD checks
```

### Step 10: Update Beads

```bash
bd update <id> --comment "PR review complete: all issues addressed, all checks passing"
bd sync
```

## Example Output

```
✓ GitHub Actions: 3 workflows
  - Build: ✓ Passing (was failing, fixed missing dependency)
  - Tests: ✓ Passing
  - Deploy Preview: ✓ Passing

✓ Greptile Review:
  Inline Comments: 8 total
  - Valid: 5 → Fixed & replied inline
  - Invalid: 2 → Explained with research evidence & replied inline
  - Out of scope: 1 → Noted for future work & replied inline
  - All marked resolved ✓

  Summary:
  - Key recommendations: 3/3 addressed
  - Overall assessment: Ready for merge
  - Posted summary response comment ✓

✓ SonarCloud (via sonarcloud skill):
  Quality Gate: ✓ Passing
  Issues: 3 total
  - Security: 1 → Fixed (SQL injection risk)
  - Code smells: 2 → 1 fixed, 1 justified
  - Coverage: Maintained at 85%

✓ Vercel Preview: ✓ Deployed successfully
✓ Security Scan: ✓ No vulnerabilities

✓ All Issues Addressed:
  - Critical: 2/2 fixed (GitHub Actions build, SonarCloud security)
  - High: 5/5 fixed (Greptile valid comments)
  - Medium: 3/3 addressed (1 fixed, 2 explained)
  - Low: 0 (none found)

✓ Fixes committed: 3c4d5e6
✓ All checks passing: ✓
✓ Beads updated: Ready for merge

Next: /premerge <pr-number>
```

```
<HARD-GATE: /review exit>
Do NOT declare /review complete until:
1. bash .claude/scripts/greptile-resolve.sh stats <pr-number> shows "All Greptile threads resolved"
2. ALL human reviewer comments are either resolved or have a reply with explanation
3. gh pr checks <pr-number> shows all checks passing
4. Context check: Run `bash scripts/beads-context.sh validate <id>` and address any warnings
5. Stage transition: Run the following → exit 0 confirmed:
   bash scripts/beads-context.sh stage-transition <id> review premerge \
     --summary "<all feedback addressed summary>" \
     --decisions "<comment resolutions — valid fixes and justified rejections>" \
     --artifacts "<fixed files, commit SHAs>" \
     --next "<doc update needs for premerge>"
</HARD-GATE>
```

## Integration with Workflow

```
Utility: /status     → Understand current context before starting
Stage 1: /plan       → Design intent → research → branch + worktree + task list
Stage 2: /dev        → Implement each task with subagent-driven TDD
Stage 3: /validate      → Type check, lint, tests, security — all fresh output
Stage 4: /ship       → Push + create PR
Stage 5: /review     → Address GitHub Actions, Greptile, SonarCloud (you are here)
Stage 6: /premerge   → Update docs, hand off PR to user
Stage 7: /verify     → Post-merge CI check on main
```
