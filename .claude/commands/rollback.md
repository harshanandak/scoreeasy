description: Safely rollback changes with USER section preservation
---

Comprehensive rollback system with multiple methods and automatic USER content preservation.

# Rollback

This command provides safe rollback operations with comprehensive validation and USER section preservation.

## Usage

```bash
bunx forge rollback
```

Interactive menu with 6 options:
1. **Rollback last commit** - Quick undo of most recent change
2. **Rollback specific commit** - Target any commit by hash
3. **Rollback merged PR** - Revert an entire PR merge
4. **Rollback specific files** - Restore only certain files
5. **Rollback entire branch** - Revert multiple commits
6. **Preview rollback** - Dry run mode (shows changes without executing)

## How It Works

### Safety Features

**1. Working Directory Check**
- Requires clean working directory (no uncommitted changes)
- Prevents accidental data loss
- Prompts to commit or stash changes first

**2. Input Validation**
- Commit hashes: Must match `/^[0-9a-f]{4,40}$/i` or be 'HEAD'
- File paths: Validated to be within project (prevents path traversal)
- Methods: Whitelisted to 'commit', 'pr', 'partial', 'branch'
- Shell metacharacters: Rejected (`;`, `|`, `&`, `$`, `` ` ``, `(`, `)`, `<`, `>`, `\n`, `\r`)

**3. USER Section Preservation**
- Automatically extracts USER sections before rollback
- Restores USER sections after rollback
- Preserves custom commands in `.claude/commands/custom/`
- Amends rollback commit to include restored content

**4. Dry Run Mode**
- Preview affected files without executing
- Shows what would change
- No git operations performed

**5. Non-Destructive**
- Uses `git revert` (creates new commit)
- Never uses `git reset --hard` (destructive)
- Preserves full git history
- Can be undone with another rollback

### USER Section Preservation

**What Gets Preserved**:
```markdown
<!-- USER:START -->
Your custom content here
<!-- USER:END -->

<!-- USER:START:custom-name -->
Named USER section
<!-- USER:END:custom-name -->
```

**Process**:
1. Extract all USER sections from AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, etc.
2. Backup custom commands from `.claude/commands/custom/`
3. Execute rollback operation
4. Restore USER sections to current file content
5. Restore custom command files
6. Amend rollback commit to include restored content

**Result**: Your customizations survive rollback operations.

## Rollback Methods

### 1. Rollback Last Commit

**Use when**: Quick undo of most recent change

**How it works**:
```bash
git revert HEAD --no-edit
```

**Example**:
```bash
bunx forge rollback
# Select: 1. Rollback last commit

✓ Working directory is clean
✓ Extracting USER sections...
✓ Executing: git revert HEAD --no-edit
✓ Restoring USER sections...
✓ Amended commit to preserve USER content

Rollback complete!
  Commit: a1b2c3d "Revert: add authentication feature"
  Files affected: 5
```

### 2. Rollback Specific Commit

**Use when**: Need to revert a commit from earlier in history

**How it works**:
```bash
git revert <commit-hash> --no-edit
```

**Example**:
```bash
bunx forge rollback
# Select: 2. Rollback specific commit
# Enter: a1b2c3d

✓ Validating commit hash...
✓ Working directory is clean
✓ Extracting USER sections...
✓ Executing: git revert a1b2c3d --no-edit
✓ Restoring USER sections...
✓ Amended commit to preserve USER content

Rollback complete!
  Commit: x9y8z7w "Revert: a1b2c3d"
  Files affected: 8
```

**Input validation**:
- Accepts 4-40 character hex strings
- Accepts 'HEAD'
- Rejects shell metacharacters
- Rejects invalid formats

### 3. Rollback Merged PR

**Use when**: Need to revert an entire merged pull request

**How it works**:
```bash
git revert -m 1 <merge-commit-hash> --no-edit
```

**Example**:
```bash
bunx forge rollback
# Select: 3. Rollback merged PR
# Enter: def456 (merge commit hash)

✓ Validating commit hash...
✓ Working directory is clean
✓ Extracting USER sections...
✓ Executing: git revert -m 1 def456 --no-edit
✓ Restoring USER sections...
✓ Amended commit to preserve USER content
✓ Beads integration: Issue #123 marked as 'reverted'

Rollback complete!
  Commit: m1n2o3p "Revert: Merge pull request #123"
  Files affected: 15
  Beads issue: #123 status → reverted
```

**Beads Integration**:
- Parses commit message for issue number (`#123`)
- If found, runs: `bd update <id> --status reverted --comment "PR reverted"`
- Silently skips if Beads not installed
- Updates issue tracking automatically

### 4. Rollback Specific Files

**Use when**: Only certain files need to be restored

**How it works**:
```bash
git checkout HEAD~1 -- <file1> <file2> ...
git commit -m "Rollback: <files>"
```

**Example**:
```bash
bunx forge rollback
# Select: 4. Rollback specific files
# Enter: AGENTS.md,CLAUDE.md

✓ Validating file paths...
✓ Working directory is clean
✓ Extracting USER sections...
✓ Executing: git checkout HEAD~1 -- AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md
✓ Committing changes...
✓ Restoring USER sections...
✓ Amended commit to preserve USER content

Rollback complete!
  Commit: q4r5s6t "Rollback: AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md"
  Files affected: 2
```

**Path validation**:
- Comma-separated file paths
- Validates paths are within project root
- Prevents path traversal (`../../../etc/passwd`)
- Rejects shell metacharacters
- Uses `path.resolve()` + `startsWith()` check

### 5. Rollback Entire Branch

**Use when**: Need to revert a range of commits

**How it works**:
```bash
git revert <start-commit>..<end-commit> --no-edit
```

**Example**:
```bash
bunx forge rollback
# Select: 5. Rollback entire branch
# Enter: abc123..def456

✓ Validating commit range...
✓ Working directory is clean
✓ Extracting USER sections...
✓ Executing: git revert abc123..def456 --no-edit
✓ Restoring USER sections...
✓ Amended commit to preserve USER content

Rollback complete!
  Commits reverted: 7
  Files affected: 24
```

**Range validation**:
- Format: `start..end`
- Both commits must be valid hashes (4-40 chars)
- Rejects invalid formats
- Checks for `..` separator

### 6. Preview Rollback (Dry Run)

**Use when**: Want to see what would change without executing

**How it works**:
- Prompts for method and target
- Validates inputs
- Shows affected files
- No git operations performed

**Example**:
```bash
bunx forge rollback
# Select: 6. Preview rollback (dry run)
# Enter method: partial
# Enter target: AGENTS.md,package.json

✓ Validating inputs...
✓ DRY RUN MODE - No changes will be made

Preview of rollback:
  Method: partial
  Target: AGENTS.md, package.json

  Files that would be affected:
    - AGENTS.md
    - package.json

  USER sections that would be preserved:
    - AGENTS.md: 2 sections

  Custom commands that would be preserved:
    - .claude/commands/custom/my-workflow.md

No changes made (dry run).
```

## Integration with Workflow

### When to Use Rollback

**During Development** (`/dev`):
- Implemented wrong approach
- Tests reveal fundamental issues
- Need to start over with different strategy

**After Shipping** (`/ship`):
- PR feedback requires complete redesign
- CI/CD failures indicate architecture problems
- Breaking changes need to be reverted

**After Merging** (`/premerge` + user merge):
- Production issues discovered
- Need to revert feature entirely
- Rollback PR merge commit

**Recovery Scenarios**:
- Accidentally committed sensitive data (rollback + force push)
- Merge conflict resolution went wrong
- Refactor broke existing functionality

### Workflow Integration

```bash
# Standard workflow
/status → /plan → /dev → /validate → /ship → /review → /premerge → /verify

# Recovery workflow
/dev → (issues discovered) → bunx forge rollback → /dev (retry)
/ship → (CI fails) → bunx forge rollback → /dev (fix) → /ship
/verify → (production issues) → bunx forge rollback → /plan (redesign)
```

### Example: Failed Feature Implementation

```bash
# 1. Development phase - implement feature
/dev
# ... implementation ...
git commit -m "feat: add payment integration"

# 2. Check phase - tests fail
/validate
# ERROR: Security vulnerability in payment handling

# 3. Rollback the implementation
bunx forge rollback
# Select: 1. Rollback last commit

# 4. Plan with security in mind
/plan payment-integration

# 5. Implement correctly
/dev
# ... proper implementation with security ...

# 6. Verify and ship
/validate → /ship
```

## Beads Integration

If Beads is installed (`bun install -g @beads/bd`), rollback automatically updates issue tracking.

### PR Rollback → Issue Status

When rolling back a merged PR:
1. Parse commit message for issue number (`#123`, `fixes #456`, etc.)
2. If issue number found:
   ```bash
   bd update <id> --status reverted --comment "PR reverted by rollback"
   ```
3. Silently skip if:
   - Beads not installed
   - No issue number in commit message
   - Issue doesn't exist

### Manual Beads Update

If automatic detection doesn't work:
```bash
# After rollback
bd update 123 --status reverted --comment "Rolled back due to production issues"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Working directory not clean"

**Cause**: Uncommitted changes in working directory

**Solution**:
```bash
# Option 1: Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "wip: current work"

# Option 2: Stash changes
git stash

# Then retry rollback
bunx forge rollback
```

### Error: "Invalid commit hash format"

**Cause**: Commit hash doesn't match required pattern

**Valid formats**:
- `HEAD` (special keyword)
- `a1b2c3d` (4-40 character hex string)
- `abc123def456` (longer hash)

**Invalid formats**:
- `abc;rm -rf /` (contains shell metacharacter)
- `12` (too short, < 4 chars)
- `not-a-hash` (not hexadecimal)

**Solution**:
```bash
# Get valid commit hash
git log --oneline
# Copy full or abbreviated hash (4+ chars)
```

### Error: "Path outside project"

**Cause**: File path resolves to outside project root

**Examples**:
- `../../../etc/passwd` (path traversal)
- `/absolute/path/outside/project`

**Solution**:
```bash
# Use relative paths within project
bunx forge rollback
# Select: 4. Rollback specific files
# Enter: src/auth.js,docs/API.md (relative paths)
```

### Error: "Invalid characters in path"

**Cause**: File path contains shell metacharacters

**Rejected characters**: `;`, `|`, `&`, `$`, `` ` ``, `(`, `)`, `<`, `>`, `\n`, `\r`

**Solution**:
```bash
# Remove special characters from filename
mv "file;name.js" "filename.js"

# Or escape properly (not recommended)
```

### Error: "Branch range must use format: start..end"

**Cause**: Branch range doesn't include `..` separator

**Valid formats**:
- `abc123..def456`
- `a1b2c3d..x9y8z7w`

**Invalid formats**:
- `abc123-def456` (wrong separator)
- `abc123` (no range)

**Solution**:
```bash
# Use correct format
bunx forge rollback
# Select: 5. Rollback entire branch
# Enter: <start-commit>..<end-commit>
```

### Merge Conflicts During Rollback

**Cause**: Revert conflicts with subsequent changes

**Solution**:
```bash
# 1. Rollback creates conflict markers
git status
# On branch: main
# Unmerged paths:
#   both modified: src/auth.js

# 2. Resolve conflicts manually
# Edit src/auth.js, remove markers

# 3. Complete the revert
git add src/auth.js
git revert --continue

# 4. USER sections restored automatically
```

### USER Sections Not Restored

**Cause**: Markers missing or malformed

**Check markers**:
```bash
grep -n "USER:START" AGENTS.md
grep -n "USER:END" AGENTS.md
```

**Valid markers**:
```markdown
<!-- USER:START -->
Content
<!-- USER:END -->

<!-- USER:START:name -->
Named section
<!-- USER:END:name -->
```

**Invalid markers**:
```markdown
<!-- USER START --> (missing colon)
<!-- USER:START (missing closing -->)
<!-- USER:END --> (no matching START)
```

**Solution**:
```bash
# Fix markers before rollback
# Ensure all USER:START have matching USER:END
```

## Safety Notes

### Input Validation

All inputs are validated **before** use in git commands:

**Commit hashes**:
```javascript
if (target !== 'HEAD' && !/^[0-9a-f]{4,40}$/i.test(target)) {
  return { valid: false, error: 'Invalid commit hash format' };
}
```

**File paths**:
```javascript
const resolved = path.resolve(projectRoot, file);
if (!resolved.startsWith(projectRoot)) {
  return { valid: false, error: 'Path outside project' };
}
```

**Shell metacharacters**:
```javascript
if (/[;|&$`()<>\r\n]/.test(file)) {
  return { valid: false, error: 'Invalid characters in path' };
}
```

### Non-Destructive Operations

**Uses**:
- `git revert` (creates new commit, preserves history)
- `git checkout HEAD~1 -- <files>` (restores specific files)

**Never uses**:
- `git reset --hard` (destroys commits)
- `git push --force` (overwrites remote)
- `git clean -f` (deletes untracked files)

### Data Preservation

**Always preserved**:
- USER sections in all files
- Custom commands in `.claude/commands/custom/`
- Git history (revert creates new commits)
- Untracked files (not affected)

**Never lost**:
- Your customizations
- Work in progress (if committed/stashed)
- Remote branches (local operation only)

### Recommended Workflow

```bash
# 1. Always commit work before rollback
git add .
git commit -m "wip: current state"

# 2. Use dry run to preview
bunx forge rollback
# Select: 6. Preview rollback (dry run)

# 3. Execute rollback
bunx forge rollback
# Select appropriate method

# 4. Verify USER sections preserved
grep -A5 "USER:START" AGENTS.md

# 5. Push if needed (after verification)
git push
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Quick Undo Last Commit

```bash
# Scenario: Just committed but realized approach is wrong

git log --oneline
# abc123d (HEAD) feat: add caching layer
# def456e fix: validation bug

bunx forge rollback
# 1. Rollback last commit

# Output:
# ✓ Working directory is clean
# ✓ Extracting USER sections...
# ✓ Executing: git revert HEAD --no-edit
# ✓ Restoring USER sections...
# ✓ Rollback complete!

git log --oneline
# xyz789f (HEAD) Revert: feat: add caching layer
# abc123d feat: add caching layer
# def456e fix: validation bug
```

### Example 2: Revert Merged PR

# commit abc123
# feat: update documentation
#   AGENTS.md (should not have changed)
#   docs/API.md
#   README.md

bunx forge rollback
# 4. Rollback specific files
# Enter: AGENTS.md

# Output:
# ✓ Validating file paths...
# ✓ Working directory is clean
